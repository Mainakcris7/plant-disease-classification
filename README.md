# Plant Disease Classification 🐛🌿

In my plant disease classification project, I harnessed the power of `EfficientNetB1`, a cutting-edge deep learning model, to achieve remarkable accuracy of `0.966` after just one epoch of training. This state-of-the-art model excels at capturing intricate features and patterns within plant images, enabling precise identification of various diseases affecting crops. By leveraging transfer learning techniques, I used `EfficientNetB1` on a diverse dataset comprising images of diseased plants, allowing the model to quickly adapt and learn to differentiate between different types of plant diseases.
